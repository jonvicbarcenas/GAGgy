If a [version.json](mdc:version.json) file exists in the project, always update the list of implemented features to reflect any changes. After each feature description, append its associated version using the format:

Feature description,

where for example v1.0.0 is the original version and + 0.0.1 indicates the incremental update.
-another example is "Cleaner UI with single quantity display + v2.0.5"

The version information should be fetched from [build.gradle.kts](mdc:app/build.gradle.kts) at the android.versionName and then add incremental update

- [version.json](mdc:version.json)
